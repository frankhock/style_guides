# Basic Communication Styles

0. Record all converstations (via internal syndicated feeds and/or group chat). Memory fades but a digital archive
can last forever. Even better, it's searchable!
0. Be positive. Write in an upbeat tone as body language is generally hard to communicate.
0. Be transparent. Post status updates when you are starting work, taking a break, or leaving for the day.
0. Keep status updates short and sweet. One-liners rock!
0. Share with the company. Encourage people to post useful information about what they are working on via
group chat (i.e. Campfire). Even better, write a post about it (i.e. internal syndicated feed).
0. Share with the world. Encourage people to setup their own web site with a syndicated feed, Twitter account, Google+,
etc. to talk about what they are passionate about.
