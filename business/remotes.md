# Remote Employee Styles

## Things to Do

* Having remote teams prooves who can get things done and who can't. The problem with office workers is that they have
  time to smooze, talk people up, and generally be very friendly people which can mask the truth of actually getting
  work done. People tend to ignore these warning signs unless the situation is really bad. When you are remote, none of
  that exists. The only thing that matters is getting things done.
* It helps (but is not a requirement) if people know each other well (personality types, temperaments, etc) before
  enabling a team to go remote.
* Team members who are generally quite, focused, disciplined and like to work in distraction free environments tend
  to really shine in remote work environments. These are the people you want. These are your true workers.

## Things to Avoid

* Don't allow snippy-comments to be said.
* Don't allow passive aggressive responses.
* Don't allow any type of mean, aggressive, or jerk-like behavior.
