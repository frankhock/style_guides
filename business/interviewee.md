# Interviewee Styles

* Always keep your online portfolio (i.e. Twitter, web site/syndicated feeds, open source work, etc.) and resume
  up-to-date.
* Always spellcheck everything you write.
* Always avoid buzzwords like the plague. Speak/write clearly for everything you describe.
* Always make sure you know the company dress code before appearing in person.
* Always know the date, time, and length of the interview (*double check the details - first impressions are critical*).
* Always know everyone involved in the interview. Write the names and roles down and keep them with you the entire time.
* Be relaxed, enjoy the process, and stay positive. Remember: It's a two-way street and you're interviewing the
  company too!
* Use each interview as a learning experience. You can always adapt and course correct.
* Consider interviewing once a year to keep your skills sharp and keeping a pulse on the ever changing landscape.
  Who knows when opportunity might strike!
* Never ask about salary (and definitely never in front of the entire team). Wait for the employeer to make the offer
  and always talk to the hiring manager directly.
* Never ask how you did at the end of an interview. Getting a repeat request or further inquiries will be your answer.
* Never badmouth your former employeer, always speak positively as to why you are moving on.
* Never lie. You'll always earn more respect for simply saying you don't know the answer.
