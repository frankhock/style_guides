# Code Review Styles

## General

- When programming styles/opions clash, reach a quick compromise and move on. Everyone is entitled to their opinion but
  not every opinion will ship code.
- Be critical of the code, not the author.
- Ask questions rather than making demands:
    - What do you think about?
    - Did you consider?
    - Can you clarify?
- Switch to face-to-face discussions when digital discussions get lengthy/complex.

## When Being Reviewed

- Be grateful of suggestions.
- Extract enhancements/refactorings, when detected, to future stories.
- Try to respond to any/all comments.
- Once reviewed, allow the reviewer to merge.

## When Reviewing Code

- Understand why the code is necessary.
- Be explicit about what should be changed and what is opinion (i.e. no action necessary).
- Try to offer alternative solutions.
- If typos or easy fixes are detected, consider committing the changes yourself and messaging the author afterwards.
- Merge the code once reviewed and confident of the changes.
