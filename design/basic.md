# Basic Design Styles

## Overview

Design is:

* Psychology.
* Neuroscience.
* Linguistics.
* Sociology.
* Philosophy.
* Understanding Humans.

In order to to:

* Enlighten
* Amuse
* Delight
* Empower

We all have one chance at this life, why not make it a good one - a memorable one.

# General

* Build upon existing, common design standards.
* Use negative space - Separate navigation from content, sections from bodies, text from images, etc.

# Navigation

* Navigation should be effortless without loosing a sense of where one is in the hierarchy.
* Keep navigation level depth to five clicks or less - it shouldn't require a lot of clicking to find content.
* Always make actionable elements (i.e. links, buttons) clearly standout with minimum thought for action.
* Use tabbed navigation:
    * Always associate the active tab with the current page (using a prominent color, font size, etc.)
    * When hovering over tabs, each tab being hovered should be visibly highlighted.
* Use a site logo:
    * Always have it link to the home page.
    * Associate it with main site navigation at all times so that people know they are still on the same site.
* Use a search form:
    * Associate it with main site navigation.
    * Keep it small but easy to see.
    * Always label it as "Search" and nothing else.
    * Always search for entire site content from a single form.
* Use page labels:
    * Must be present on every page (generally top-left corner of page, depending on site design).
    * Must always match the same text used in the navigation link.
    * Must be prominent of and of a larger font than the rest of the page content.
* Use breadcrumbs:
    * Use for deeply nested hierarchies.
    * Should be located at the top of the page content (above the page title).
    * Use '>' to indicate hierarchy (better than ':', '|', '/' because it better visuallizes depth).
    * Use a small font. It shouldn't take up a lot of space.
    * The last item in the breadcrumbs should be identical to the page label.

# Text

* Refrain from happy/promotional text - This is filler text that doesn't provide any useful information. Instead,
  get to the point and make each word count. Be ruthless in removing extraneous words.
