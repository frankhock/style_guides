# Group Chat Styles

0. Use [basic communication](basic.md) styles.
0. Provides the following:
  - Keeps communication as asynchronous as possible.
  - Provides transparent communication so that all staff may participate that have interest.
  - Ensures automatic history for old conversations which can be searched and resurfaced.
  - Enables remote/mobile access for those traveling or constantly on the move.
0. Use group chat software for asynchronous communication (example: [Slack](https://slack.com)).
0. Structure chats/rooms at a company wide level as follows:
  - General - General company level communications, discussions, questions, etc.
  - Announcements - Official company alerts, news, and updates.
  - Emergencies - Production level issues that must be addressed immediately.
    - Keep this chat open at all times or when you are on call.
    - Ensure notifications are enabled for your mobile device.
  - Sales - News related to customer sign-up, revenue earned, contracts signed, etc.
    - Try to limit the information to simply *(customer/contract) - (new revenue earned)*.
    - Try to limit responses so the room doesn't get too noisy...excitement is
      inevitable/understandable. :)
  - Marketing - News related to global/public promotional/awareness efforts.
  - Development - General technical news, discussions, etc. related to the software development.
  - (team) - Teams specific news. Use the following sub-structure (create the same structure per
    team): (see [Iterations](../business/iterations.md) for more info):
    - (team) Plans - For start of week planning.
    - (team) Standups - For daily member status updates:
      - Start of Work - Keep it light, cheerful. Maybe include a picture of where you are.
      - Standup - Can be part of *Start of Work- or follow directly after.
      - Away From Keyboard (AFK). Examples: Grabbing lunch, taking care of the kids, running a quick
        errand, etc.
      - End of Work - Keep it light, sincere, even funny but do let people know you are done for the
        day.
      - Out of Office (OOO). Examples: Errands, sickness, upcomming vacation reminders, etc.
    - (team) Retrospectives - For end-of-week retrospectives.
  - Development Notifications - For automated notifications like Git updates, build failures,
    deployments, etc.
  - Demos - For end-of-week demos to show off the week's cumulative work. Doesn't have to limited to
    end-of-week but can be anytime there is something of interest to share.
  - After Hours - News and information related to after hours adventures, gatherings, etc. Examples:
      - Snow - Ski/snowboarding information and events.
      - Games - Video/board game information and events.
0. Tips
  - Only keep chat rooms open that are of value and critical to getting the job done. The rest can
    be entered as time allows.
  - Limit notifications for rooms that are too noisy/distracting. Some clients allow notifications
    to be silenced per room so room distractions can be limited.
  - For the noisest of group chats, consider muting and then checking three times a day (morning,
    noon, and night) like good [email styles](email.md).
  - Most group chat services provide desktop and mobile applications. Install and use both.
