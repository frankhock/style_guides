# General

* Build upon existing, common design standards.
* Use negative space - Separate navigation from content, sections from bodies, text from images, etc.

# Navigation

* Navigation should be effortless without loosing a sense of where one is in the hierarchy.
* Keep navigation level depth to five clicks or less - it shouldn't require a lot of clicking to find content.
* Always make actionable elements (i.e. links, buttons) clearly standout with minimum thought for action.

# Text

* Refrain from happy/promotional text - This is filler text that doesn't provide any useful information. Instead,
  get to the point and make each word count. Be ruthless in removing extraneous words.
