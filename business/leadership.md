# Leadership Styles

## Guidelines

0. Earn and maintain the respect and trust of your team.
0. Empower teammates with the autonomy to be creative and solve problems.
0. Allow teammates to gain/achieve mastery.
0. Empower teammates with a sense of purpose/drive.
0. Protect teammates from daily distractions and interruptions.
0. Identify weaknesses and focus on turning them into strengths but also build upon existing strengths.
0. Be human. Always strive to make a connection with each and every one of your teammates so that you can understand
   who they are, what drives them, and how best to help them grow.
0. Be honest:
  - Be quick to constructively criticise. The longer you wait, the worse the situation will become.
  - Give praise but only when it is sincere and meaningful. Get this wrong and you'll do more damage than never
    giving praise in the first place. Plus, you'll lose credibility and respect.
0. Be transparent: Share information often, clearly, and concisely.
0. Be empathetic and caring -- Strive to listen and understand what motivates people:
  - Past: Listen to where they came from, what makes them tick, and how they got to where they are now.
  - Present: Listen to what they think of the current situation, how they feel about it, and how they would change it.
  - Future: Listen to what drives them, where they are excited about going, and how you can help in these endeavors.
0. Be decisive but not a dictator:
  - Always base decisions on productivity not politics.
  - Never mandate how work will be performed/completed.
  - Facilitate and listen. Let the team come to their own conclusions.
  - Debate and clarify all decisions.
  - Negotiate diversity and resistance into resolved actions.
  - Don't be afraid to delegate decisions to people that know the information better than you.
  - Don't defer decisions to senior staff when people, in the meeting, know the information better.
0. Be a motivator. Do this for every teammate by taking action, when necessary, to engage people in the mission
   and vision of the team/company.
0. Be accountable. Be responsible for tasks assigned to the team and hold teammates to the same standard for their
   work accordingly.
0. Be a peer to the team.
0. Be additional help when help is needed.
0. Remember that excellent management doesn't scale. Limit your time and attention team to five people or less.
0. Have faith and confidence in your team.

# Tactics

The following is taken word-for-word from [My Management Lessons from Three Failed Startups, Google, Apple, Dropbox, Twitter and Square](http://www.timeforpool.com/2/post/2014/02/my-management-lessons-from-three-failed-startups-google-apple-dropbox-twitter-and-squareread.html):

- **Give excellent ratings to everyone who is performing exceptionally**: Even at some of the best companies, people who have valuable skills but who aren’t likely to “take over the world,” will often be rated as meeting expectations because managers reserve high ratings for people they're going to promote. This creates an unhealthy promotion-obsessed culture.
- **Put the gradual growth achievers in positions where they can train others**: Capitalize on their dependency, their thoroughness, and their dedication to the company. They will be your best teachers, and it’s a way to put them on stage even when they shy away from the spotlight. “Don’t promote them,” Scott advises. “They don’t want to be promoted. If you make them a manager, you’ll destroy an asset.”
- **Don’t ignore the middle**: Very few people are truly mediocre. “If someone has been somewhere more than two years and has just met expectations the whole time, it’s time to ask yourself the hard question: If they weren’t there could you hire somebody more likely to excel?
- **Evaluate skilled underperformers**: If somebody is not doing well in their role but is talented, it’s time to look at yourself in the mirror: Have you put this person in the wrong role? Is your management style just a bad fit for the person? Is this person experiencing a temporary personal problem?
- **Make the tough calls**: If someone truly is bad at their job and they are unlikely ever to improve — that’s key — you have to fire them. “Don’t put it off. All that’s going to do is piss off your top performers and burn them out,” Scott says. “It may seem harsh, but it’s also harsh to let your top performers carry the burden for underperformers.”

## Growth Trajectories (for high performing employees)

- Steep (can be high maintenance and might not stay in one place for long):
  - Push them to tackle new challenges.
  - Cleary define their path to promotion.
  - Make them your thought partner.
  - Don't ignore them because of their independence or belief they don't need to be managed.
- Slow (stable and tend to remain in their roles for some time)
  - Honor them for the great work they do because, very often, they go unrecognized.

## Maintenance

- Maintain weekly 1x1 meetings with the following structure:
  - You:
    - What should I start doing?
    - What should I stop doing?
    - What should I keep doing?
  - Them:
    - What do you want to be doing?
    - What are you not doing?
    - What do you feel you ought to be doing?
  - Tips:
    - Always block an hour of time (maybe you don't fill it but ensuring plenty of time shows value).
    - Pick a casual settings: lunch at a restuarant, a beach walk, a brief hike, a stroll in the meadows, etc.
    - Allowing people to open up and tell the truth is hard and uncomfortable. Ask the uncomfortable questions and
      don't be afraid to dig deep (in a polite way, of course ;-).
    - Reward those who tell the truth by honoring their request for change. Do this through determination and
      dilligence by providing constant status updates/feedback, either privately or publically, until the change
      is solidified.
