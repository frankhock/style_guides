# Culture Styles

"The only reliable way to muster motivation is by encouraging people to work on the stuff they like and care about,
with people they like and care about. There are no shortcuts." -- Remote: Office Not Requred.

"Motivation is pivotal to healthy lives and healthy companies. Make sure you’re minding it."
-- Remote: Office Not Required.

  When performance is poor, clearly communicate why and provide aid to turn the problem or weakness into a postive
  outcome.

  team code of conduct is violated, decisive action is taken and the culprits are held responsible for their actions.

  allowed sustained overtime should be prevented in order to counter burnout.

  instead of knowing everything.
* Relative Pay - Pay and compensation should be equal to or higher than the industry average. Period.
* No Trophies - You are hired to for expertise and professionalism - not for bragging rights, promotional capabilities,
  or a prized position of your boss/employeer.

## Foster Employee Self-Motivation

The following is based off of [Good to Great](http://www.amazon.com/Good-Great-Companies-Leap-Others/dp/0066620996/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=8-1&qid=1375567924) by Jim Collins.
where the goal is to hire good people and then focus on motivating without being demotivating. There are four basic
practices for establishing company culture where self motivations can flourish:

0. Lead with questions, not answers.
0. Engage in dialog and debate.
0. Conduct autopsies without blame.
0. Build red flag mechanisms - Make it easy for customers/employees to speak up when they find an issue.

## Behavior Improvement Exercises

The following is taken from [Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us](http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1375569191&sr=8-1&keywords=Drive) by Daniel H. Pink
to encourage employee/team improvement:

0. Implement 20% time with training wheels (by starting at 10% and working up).
0. Allow members of a team to randomly give rewards for being exceptional at what they do.
0. Take an Autonomy Audit - On a scale of 1-10, rank the following (with 10 being the highest):
    0. How much autonomy do you have over your tasks in a given day?
    0. How much autonomy do you have over your time in a given day?
    0. How much autonomy do you have over your team (being able to choose the members you work with)?
    0. How much autonomy do you have over your technique (how you solve problems)?
0. Take three steps towards giving up control (Type-I bosses let members decide):
    0. Involve people in goal settings.
    0. Use non-controlling language.
    0. Hold "office hours" so that any employee can talk with you.
    0. Who's purpose is it?
    0. Test for pronouns. Do the employees use "they" or "we/us". The latter is best.
    0. Design for intrinsic motivation. Give users autonomy, mastery, and purpose.
    0. Promote Goldilocks tasks (i.e. simple tasks that can be easily accomplished within harder tasks) for groups:
        0. Begin with a diverse team.
        0. Make the group a no-competition zone. Be collaborative/cooperative.
        0. Try task shifting. If a member is bored, shift to having that member teach another member what he/she knows.
        0. Animate with purpose, don't animate with rewards.
    0. Turn your next offsite into a FedEx day - A day where employees can work on whaterver they want with whomever
       they like. Must deliver the next day.
