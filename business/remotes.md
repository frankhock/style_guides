# Remote Employee Styles

## Things to Do

* *Always* treat remote workers as first class citizens. Helps if the founder/top manager of the company is also remote.
* Having remote teams proves who can get things done and who can't. The problem with office workers is that they have
  time to smooze, talk people up, and generally be very friendly people which can mask the truth of actually getting
  work done. People tend to ignore these warning signs unless the situation is really bad. When you are remote, none of
  that exists. The only thing that matters is getting things done.
* It helps (but is not a requirement) if people know each other well (personality types, temperaments, etc) before
  enabling a team to go remote.
* Team members who are generally quiet, focused, self motivated, disciplined, and like to work in distraction free
  environments tend to really shine in remote work environments. These are the people you want to hire.
* Try to perform 1x1's on a monthly basis. Keep them to 30 minutes but allow an hour if necessary. It is important to
  address concerns quickly and keep morale high. If left unaddressed, these issues can compound quickly.
* Ensure remote workers are empowered to do their job and do it well:
    * Ensure any potential roadblock and/or managerial intervention is removed.
    * Ensure everyone has access to the required resources.
    * Give each a company credit card and use it within reason/common sense.
    * Allow everyone to take vacation when necessary/needed. Allow each to coordinate with team members on scheduling.
* Watch for burn out by giving people time off and preventing people from overwork (i.e. more than 40 hours/week):
    * Maybe give every Friday off during the summer months.
    * Enable further learning (like cooking, dancing, playing an instrument) to augment current skills.
    * Host a company retreat, etc. to get face-to-face time with fellow employees.
* Encourage employees to work from different locations (i.e. library, coffee shop, home, different cities, countries,
  etc). A change of location can inspire and get people to think about problems differently.
* Encourage employees to proactively set/share goals, create projects, and recommend solutions.
* Encourage employees to stay connected and be responsible for letting everyone know when they are not avaiable and
  for how long.
* Encourage employees to constantly adapt and learn new methodologies, technologies, etc.

## Things to Avoid

* Don't allow snippy-comments to be said.
* Don't allow passive aggressive responses.
* Don't allow any type of mean, aggressive, or jerk-like behavior.
