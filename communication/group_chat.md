# Group Chat Styles

0. Use [basic communication](basic.md) styles.
0. Provides the following:
    * Keeps communication as asynchronous as possible.
    * Provides transparent communication so that all staff may participate that have interest.
    * Ensures automatic history for old conversations which can be searched and resurfaced.
    * Enables remote/mobile access for those traveling or constantly on the move.
0. Use group chat software for asynchronous communication. Examples:
    * [Campfire](https://campfirenow.com)/[Flint](http://giantcomet.com/flint/mac)
    * [Troupe](https://trou.pe)
    * [Hall](https://hall.com)
    * [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com)
0. Structure chats/rooms at a company wide level as follows:
    * General - For general company level communications, questions, etc.
    * Announcements - For official company alerts, news, and updates.
    * Sales - For news related to new customer sign-up, new revenue earned, new contracts signed, etc.
        * Try to limit the information to simply *(customer/contract) - (new revenue earned)*.
        * Try to limit responses so the room doesn't get too noisy...excitement is inevitable/understandable. :)
    * Development Notifications - For automated notifications like Git updates, build failures, deployments, etc.
    * Emergencies - For production level issues that must be addressed immediately.
    * (team) - For specific teams. Use the following sub-structure (create the same structure per team):
