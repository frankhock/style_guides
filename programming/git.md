# Git Styles

## Commits

* Always write commits in past tense. This makes it easier to build and read changelogs.
* Always prefix commits using one of the following:
    * **Fixed** - This is code that has been fixed.
    * **Removed** - This is a feature that was once added but is now removed.
    * **Added** - This is a new feature.
    * **Updated** - This is an existing feature that has been updated.
    * **Refactored** - This is a code that has been refactored.
* Use hashtags in commit messages if helpful. These can easily be searched for later.
* Use the --message option for short one-line commit messages sparingly. Better to use a short one-line commit message
  but also provide bullet points, within the commit message body, which detail and support the one-line commit message.
* Include links (via the commit message body, usually) to dependent projects, etc. if useful.

## Tags

* Always tag your releases.
    * Makes it easier to build changelogs.
    * Makes it easier to compare differences between versions.
    * Makes adoption of the new changes easier and faster.
