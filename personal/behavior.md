# Personal Behavior Styles

These best practices are based off of [Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us](http://www.amazon.com/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates/dp/1594484805/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1375569191&sr=8-1&keywords=Drive) by Daniel H. Pink.

## The Three Tenants of Motivation

These are the guiding principles of what motivates people to accomplish great things:

1. Autonomy - The freedom and ability to get things done. Requires control over Task, Team, Time, and Technique.
2. Mastery - To gain thorough knowledge and experience of a subject.
3. Purpose - The passion and drive to focus on the things that matter most.

## Behavior Improvement Steps

Apply the following steps in order to discover weaknesses and make improvements:

0. Set random interrupt notifications. Write down what you are doing at the interruption. Are you in flow?
Keep a log of this for a week and/or month to determine what needs improvement.
0. Define, in one sentence, what your life purpose is.
0. Ask yourself if you are better today than you were yesterday? Is progress being made? What needs to change?
0. Take a year off every seven years to reflect, explore, and live life.
0. Give yourself a performance review every month and figure out what worked and failed? Be brutally honest.
Is progress being made? What needs to change?
0. [Go oblique](https://twitter.com/Oblique_Chirps) when stuck. Read one of these each time you are stuck to give
your mind something to focus on while the subconscious chips away at the real problem.
0. Maintain deliberate practice:
    0. Measure and improve performance.
    0. Repeat. Repeat. Repeat.
    0. Ask for constant feedback.
    0. Focus ruthlessly on weaknesses and turn them into strengths.
    0. Prepare for mental exhaustion.
0. Keep asking yourself the following:
    0. What gets you up in the morning?
    0. What keeps you up at night?
    0. What are you going to do about each?
